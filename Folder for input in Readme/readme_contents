1. Abstract of the Project
This project investigates the bas eic ideas and real-world uses of a Cartesian manipulator, with an emphasis on their kinematics from a variety of angles, such as degrees
of freedom (DOF), Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) notation, homogeneous transformation matrices, parametric tables, as well as the opposite Kinematics. The research starts with an exclusive:

-explanation of the DOF 
-utilization of D-H notation
-establishment of the D-H parametric tables
-defining the transformation matrices
-computing inverse kinematics 

2. Introduction of the Project
  Cartesian manipulators, the tireless workhorses of manufacturing floors, have been present since industrial robotics' inception. 
  Their beginnings can be traced back to the 1950s when they first appeared alongside other pioneering robot designs.  
  These early robots were developed in the United States by companies such as Unimation, which in 1961 produced the Versatran, the world's first commercially viable industrial robot.  
  The Versatran was not a cartesian manipulator, but its contemporaries, which had linear actuators on each axis, paved the way for the design.
  Cartesian manipulators, unlike robots with rotating joints, move in straight lines along each of the three axes (x, y, z). 
  This enables for extremely exact positioning of the end effector, which is a tool or gripper attached to the arm. This precision makes them suitable for jobs like pick-and-place procedures, in which parts must be moved quickly and precisely from one spot to another. 
  Cartesian manipulators continue to be useful in assembly lines, machine tending, and material handling.
  Cartesian manipulators remain an important feature of modern industrial automation, despite their limited reach and flexibility when compared to advanced robots.
  Their simple form allows for easy programming and maintenance, making them an affordable alternative for a wide range of industrial activities.

3. Degrees of Freedom of Cartesian Manipulator
  To solve a DOF of a specific manipulator the first thing to do is to determine whether it is a spatial with 6 DOF or planar with 3 DOF. 
  The next step is to figure out the number of joints and moving links on the manipulator. 
  After that, the calculation of the number of joint constraints in the given manipulator and determining if it is spatial or planar with the help of Grubler’s Criterion. 
  Lastly, determine the type of manipulator based on the number of degrees of freedom.
  To calculate the degrees of freedom of the Cartesian Manipulator, use Grubler's Formula.

4. Kinematic Diagram and D-H Frame assignment of cartesian description and computation.
  The Denavit-Hartenberg Notation, often known as D-H Notation, was developed in 1995 by Jacques Denavit and Richard Hartenberg to standardize coordinate frames for spatial links.
  To solve the forward kinematics of a mechanical manipulator we will use the DH Notation (Denavit-Hartenberg Notation)

  The D-H notation offers a systematic approach to express the geometric configuration of robotic systems, making kinematic analysis and modeling easier.

  It is frequently used in robotics, particularly industrial robot systems, and robot arms with manipulators.

  In DH notation, there are some preliminary rules and main rules that define how to assign coordinate frames and determine the parameters for each joint.

  D-H Frame Preliminary Rules

  Rule 1 Decide first the 3 views you want to project on your isometric drawing

  Rule 2: Identify the center of your frames

  Rule 3 Then draw your color-coded arrows based on your decided 3 views.
      Blue- z-axis
      Red- x-axis
      Green- y-axis
  
Rule 4: Remember to make the arrows of the z and x axes easy to see in future computation
      The y axis less important than the x and z axes

5. D-H Parametric Table of cartesian manipulator description and computation.
The D-H Parametric Table, which is frequently found in research publications and industrial robot manuals, is a shortcut for locating homogeneous transformation matrices.
There are four parameters in the D-H Parametric Table:

θ and α are the two parameters that are used for rotation and orientation.

R and D are the two parameters that are used for position/translation.

Columns = no. of parameters

Rows = no. of frames - 1

Denavit Hartenberg Parameters:

Theta (θ) - Rotation around Zn-1 that is required to get Xn-1 to match Xn with the joint variable if joint is Revolute/Twisting joint.

Alpha (α) - Rotation around Xn that is required to get Zn-1 to match Zn.

d - The distance from the origin of n-1 and n frames along the Zn-1 direction with a joint variable if joint is prismatic

r - The distance from the origin of n-1 and n frames along the Xn directions.

  

6. HTM of a Cartesian Manipulator
  In a treasure hunt analogy, a Hierarchical Task Manager (HTM) acts like a special code guiding a friend to hidden loot. No matter the starting point in the room, the HTM provides clear instructions in two parts:
     Direction: This part tells the friend which way to turn (left, right, up, down) to face the treasure chest.
     Steps: Once facing the right direction, the code specifies how many steps to take to reach the treasure.

  Now, imagine a robotic arm replacing the treasure in the room. HTMs function similarly but in a 3D space, instructing the robot's computer on two key actions:
      Rotate the Arm: This is akin to pointing a "finger" in the right direction, just like aiming for the treasure.
      Extend the Arm: The code also dictates how far the robot's arm needs to extend (like taking steps) to reach and grasp an object. 

  By combining these instructions (pointing and reaching) into a single code (HTM), the robot's computer can precisely control where the arm goes
  This simplifies understanding and controlling even complex robot arms with many joints, ensuring they reach their designated positions accurately. 

Homogeneous transformation matrices enable us to combine rotation matrices (which hav 3 rows and 3 columns) and displacments 
vectors (which have 3 rows and 1 column) into a single matrix. They are an important concept of forward Kinematics.

7. Inverse Kinematics of cartesian manipulator description and computation
The method known as "Inverse kinematics" or "IK" determines the ideal or necessary mobility of a networked system of objects to reach a specific location. IK is able to
calculate the proper motion of a robotic arm in order to position the actuator at its terminus. IK can be turned on in 3-D animation software to allow parent objects to be 
automatically affected by the movement of a child joint in a hierarchical character rig.

For instance, an animator can naturally move and rotate the shin, thigh, and knee joints when animating a 3-D human character with IK enabled. This is accomplished by raising 
the character's ankle joint. 

Advantages: 

For simulating a human arm's movement.
For the precise end-effector placement.

Disadvantage:

Challenging to resolve
 
8. Forward and Inverse Kinematics GUl calculator of cartesian manipulator description and computation
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) calculator that computes the Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics 
of a Cartesian manipulator may be found in the GUI.py code.



Forward KInematics (FK)
The f_k() function is utilize to calculate the end-effector position ( X, Y, Z ) of the manipulator from the given set of joint variables (d1, d2, d3 ).

Inverse Kinematics (IK) 
the i_k() function is utilize to calculate the joint variable ( d1, d2, d3 ) by moving the end-effector to a desired position ( X, Y, Z ).
